## FASIGHT
Digital will binding made easy.

#Inspiration
i(sayyid) got the inspiration from reading a book about financial planning and i realised that as i was reading about the chapter of legacy financial planning, that many people have limited infomation regarding on how to build a will on help them manage their finances even in their afterlife.

currently, most people dont know that if one passes away, all financial assets that belong to the account owner freezes which makes the immediate family members/next of kin hard to access to finance.

we are also stuck in the stuation on how to distribute funds and financial rulings to the the next-of-kin due to the lack of the will which was not build due to "lack of access" to information and convenience.

#What it does
It is a four step process where,

It helps to gather answer through questions in a easy and most automated approach.
The will is sent out to the respective guarantors via an email link to be activated at a later date.
Makes the will digital binding (turns it into a digital will allowing it to extend the person "will" beyond his/her lifespan)
allows easy access of the funds/assets to the right assigned to next-of-kin.

#How we built it
we used django as a web server to allow users to create profile to create a digital will. we used HTML,CSS,JS for the styling of the website. For the design framework we used, BOOTSTRAP V4.0

#Challenges we ran into
Our main challenge that we are facing is none of us a law students, so gathering through the necessary information required to create a legal binding is the main problem that we are facing.

#Accomplishments that we're proud of
That we managed to build a working web server within 24 hours.

#What we learned
This hackathon is the first one that I've ever been to! I've learned how to implement a website using django and how it's framework...works! As a freshman in computer science, I have a module called Data Structures in C. Part of my contributions in this project was creating the data structures (in python) used in it. This gave me a foresight of how my current modules, be it basic or simple, goes into projects and not just knowledge.

#What's next for fasight
the shariah law has different rules for binding a will, continuing the project, we would look into creating a shariah compliant islamic digital binding will.
